# North-Star [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/akasfei/North-Star.png)](http://travis-ci.org/akasfei/North-Star)

North Star is an online blog website built with Node.js and Mongodb.

## Getting Started

### Get North Star

* [Download the latest release](https://github.com/akasfei/North-Star/zipball/master).
* Clone the repo: `git clone git://github.com/akasfei/North-Star.git`.

### Get Node.js and Mongodb

You can get Node.js at [http://www.nodejs.org/](http://www.nodejs.org/)

Please note that when this README file is being written, North Star has only been tested
on Node.js 0.8.x. Support on other versions is not guaranteed.

You can get Mongodb at [http://www.mongodb.org/](http://www.mongodb.org/)

Mongodb version 2.0 or newer is supported.

### Clear hot

Before launching the application, please ensure that mongodb is running.

> mongod

Then you may start the server:

> % node app.js

If this is the first time you start the server, an administrator account will be created:

>Access ID  : Forty Two
>
>Access code: SFEI_HEART_OPENSOURCE

All right, that's all there is to do it. Visit [localhost](http://localhost/) to see your application!

## Documentation

Available on [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/akasfei/North-Star/wiki)

Only several pages available at this moment. More coming up!

## Roadmap

I'm planning to convert this blog website into an API server that will provide service to mulitple platforms. This update will be completed before SFEI Systems v4. In version 4, I will add many new features to the website, but then this website will look more like a web application than a traditional website.

Detailed roadmap of SFEI Systems, from 3.3.2 to 4.5.0, is availalbe on [GitHub Wiki](https://github.com/akasfei/North-Star/wiki/Roadmap)
